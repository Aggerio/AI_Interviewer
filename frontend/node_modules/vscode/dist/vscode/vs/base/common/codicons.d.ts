 * The Codicon library is a set of default icons that are built-in in VS Code.

 * In the product (outside of base) Codicons should only be used as defaults. In order to have all icons in VS Code
 * themeable, component should define new, UI component specific icons using `iconRegistry.registerIcon`.
 * In that call a Codicon can be named as default.
